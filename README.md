# ASK — Arcada studerandekar

Public multilingual website and protected backoffice for ASK. Swedish is the primary public language, English is available throughout, and Finnish is supported for Cor House agreements.

## What is included

- modern responsive public site, navigation, search, SEO, sitemap, accessibility statement and ASKungen help widget
- news, events, notices, people and bilingual page publishing with editorial review and revision history
- Cor House availability, multi-date bookings, resource conflict checks, association/member verification, pricing, private status links, cancellations, manual PDF agreements and cleaning/damage evidence
- editable Cor pricing, capacities and request limits, plus live weather and HSL-ready nearby departures
- public council documents, association/partner directory and event partnerships
- privacy notices, cookie/terms pages, contact forms, retention fields and GDPR data-request workflow
- protected role-based backoffice, audit log, media uploads, CSV exports, integration register and notification outbox
- seasonal theme scheduling and the yellow ASKungen mascot with ASK ribbon/medal styling

## Administration

- `/admin` — content editor
- `/admin/platform` — bookings, blocks, partners, documents, forms, live updates, media, audit and administrators
- `/admin/integrations` — processor/integration register and queued notifications
- `/admin/settings` — Cor rules, prices, capacities and seasonal themes

Publishing content requires an approved review state and an administrator role. Association-representative accounts are defined but remain inactive until ASK assigns verified people to associations.

## External activation

Email delivery, payment/accounting, CRM, membership, Kide/Lime, analytics and HSL live departures are deliberately not enabled without ASK-owned credentials, agreements and processor review. Their records and notification queue can be prepared in the backoffice without exposing credentials in source code. Weather uses Open-Meteo and needs no credential.

## Local checks

```bash
npm run lint
npx tsc --noEmit
npm test
```

Database changes are schema-only Drizzle migrations in `drizzle/`. Apply them through the Sites release flow before using the new backoffice features.

## Technical base

A clean full-stack starter running on [vinext](https://github.com/cloudflare/vinext), with optional Cloudflare D1 and Drizzle support.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js `>=22.13.0`
- Linux with `flock`, `curl`, and GNU `timeout`

## Sites Lifecycle

The Sites lifecycle CLI runs the locked dependency install before returning this checkout. Edit the source under `app/`, then checkpoint when a coherent milestone is ready to inspect or share. The remote Sites builder runs `npm run build` against the pushed commit. Do not repeat install or build as a normal pre-checkpoint step.

This starter does not use `wrangler.jsonc`.

`install:ci` is intentionally a single, non-retrying `npm ci`. It refuses a concurrent install for the same project, consumes a matching image-seeded npm cache with `--prefer-offline` while retaining registry fallback for a missing cache object, otherwise downloads and verifies the complete vinext tarball recorded in `package-lock.json`, limits npm to one socket, and terminates a stalled install. `build` applies a short timeout. These helpers target Linux and use GNU `timeout`; they are not native macOS scripts.

Scripts that need writable project-scoped home, npm, XDG, and temporary paths use `scripts/sites-env.sh`. The `dev` and `start` scripts honor the caller's runtime environment and keep Wrangler logs inside the checkout. The generated `.sites-runtime/` directory is disposable and ignored by Git.

## Included Shape

- edit site code under `app/`
- `app/chatgpt-auth.ts` provides optional dispatch-owned ChatGPT sign-in helpers
- `.openai/hosting.json` declares optional Sites D1 and R2 bindings
- `vite.config.ts` simulates declared bindings for local development
- `db/index.ts` reads the D1 binding from the Cloudflare Worker environment
- `db/schema.ts` starts intentionally empty
- `examples/d1/` contains an optional D1 example surface
- `drizzle.config.ts` supports local migration generation when needed

## Workspace Auth Headers

OpenAI workspace sites can read the current user's email from `oai-authenticated-user-email`.

SIWC-authenticated workspace sites may also receive `oai-authenticated-user-full-name` when the user's SIWC profile has a non-empty `name` claim. The full-name value is percent-encoded UTF-8 and is accompanied by `oai-authenticated-user-full-name-encoding: percent-encoded-utf-8`.

Treat the full name as optional and fall back to email when it is absent:

```tsx
import { headers } from "next/headers";

export default async function Home() {
  const requestHeaders = await headers();
  const email = requestHeaders.get("oai-authenticated-user-email");
  const encodedFullName = requestHeaders.get("oai-authenticated-user-full-name");
  const fullName =
    encodedFullName &&
    requestHeaders.get("oai-authenticated-user-full-name-encoding") ===
      "percent-encoded-utf-8"
      ? decodeURIComponent(encodedFullName)
      : null;

  const displayName = fullName ?? email;
  // ...
}
```

## Optional Dispatch-Owned ChatGPT Sign-In

Import the ready-to-use helpers from `app/chatgpt-auth.ts` when the site needs optional or required ChatGPT sign-in:

- Use `getChatGPTUser()` for optional signed-in UI.
- Use `requireChatGPTUser(returnTo)` for server-rendered pages that should send anonymous visitors through Sign in with ChatGPT.
- In a Server Component, start sign-in with `<a href={chatGPTSignInPath(returnTo)} target="_top">`. The auth helper module is server-only; do not import it into a Client Component.
- Do not use `fetch`, XHR, a client-side router, or a framework link that can prefetch the sign-in route. SIWC must start as a top-level navigation.
- Never request the AuthAPI authorization endpoint directly. The dispatch-owned `/signin-with-chatgpt` route must start the SIWC flow.
- Use `chatGPTSignOutPath(returnTo)` for browser sign-out links or actions.
- Pass a same-origin relative `returnTo` path for the destination after sign-in or sign-out. The helper validates and safely encodes it.
- Mark protected pages with `export const dynamic = "force-dynamic"` because they depend on per-request identity headers.

Dispatch owns `/signin-with-chatgpt`, `/signout-with-chatgpt`, `/callback`, the OAuth cookies, and identity header injection. Do not implement app routes for those reserved paths. Routes that do not import and call the helper remain anonymous-compatible.

SIWC establishes identity only; it does not prove workspace membership. Use the Sites hosting platform's access policy controls for workspace-wide restrictions, or enforce explicit server-side membership or allowlist checks.

Use SIWC for account pages, user-specific dashboards, saved records, and write actions tied to the current ChatGPT user. Leave public content anonymous.

## Diagnostic Commands

- `npm run install:ci`: perform the one bounded lockfile install
- `npm run dev`: start the Vite/Vinext development server
- `npm run build`: build the deployable Sites artifact
- `npm run start`: start the built Vinext application
- `npm test`: build and verify the rendered development-preview metadata
- `npm run db:generate`: generate Drizzle migrations after schema changes

Use build commands for targeted diagnosis after a remote failure, not as part of the normal checkpoint path.

The timeout defaults can be overridden for a controlled canary with `SITES_INSTALL_TIMEOUT`, `SITES_INSTALL_KILL_AFTER`, `SITES_BUILD_TIMEOUT`, and `SITES_BUILD_KILL_AFTER`. A timeout fails the command; the helpers never retry an unchanged install or build.
